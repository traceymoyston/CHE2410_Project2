# Title: Modeling the Growth Dynamics of A20 murine leukemic cells 

Introduction 

Chronic Lymphocitic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults typically affecting populations over 70 years old. CLL is marked by the uncontrolled growth of B lymphocytes.  It is not a particularly fatal type of leukemia but survival rates do decrease with age and other risk factors. It is also difficult to cure.
